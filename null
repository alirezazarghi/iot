# Billing examples

## Example 1

Suppose you have 10,000 devices connected to IoT Platform eight hours a day. Every minute, each device sends out one message that is less than 0.5 KB in size. In this example, assume that one month has 30 days.

The fees are calculated as follows:

-   Messaging fee

    Messages sent per month: 60 \* 8 \* 30 \* 10,000 = 144 million.

    For each month, the first 100 million messages are charged at 0.5 dollars per 1 million messages. The following 44 million messages are charged at 0.4 dollars per 1 million messages. The messaging fee is: 100 \* 0.5 + 44 \* 0.4 = USD 67.6.

-   Device access fee

    Time that devices are online per month: 60 \* 8 \* 30 \* 10,000 = 144 million minutes.

    For each month, the device access fee is: 144 \* 0.3 = USD 43.2.

-   The total monthly fee is: 67.6 + 43.2 = USD 110.8.

## Example 2

Suppose you have 10,000 devices connected to IoT Platform eight hours a day. Every minute, each device sends out one message that is less than 0.5 KB in size and receives one message that is 0.4 KB in size. In this example, assume that one month has 30 days.

The fees are calculated as follows:

-   Messaging fee

    Messages sent per month: 60 \* 8 \* 30 \* 10,000 = 144 million.

    Messages received per month: 60 \* 8 \* 30 \* 10,000 = 144 million.

    Total messages per month: 144 million + 144 million = 288 million.

    For each month, the first 100 million messages are charged at 0.5 dollars per 1 million messages. The following 188 million messages are charged at 0.4 dollars per 1 million messages. The messaging fee is: 100 \* 0.5 + 188 \* 0.4 = USD 125.2.

-   Device access fee

    Time that devices are online per month: 60 \* 8 \* 30 \* 10,000 = 144 million minutes.

    For each month, the device access fee is: 144 \* 0.3 = USD 43.2.

-   The total monthly fee is: 125.2 + 43.2 = USD 168.4.

## Example 3

Suppose you have 10,000 devices connected to IoT Platform eight hours a day. Every minute, each device sends out one message that is 0.6 KB in size and receives one message that is 0.4 KB in size. In this example, assume that one month has 30 days.

The fees are calculated as follows:

-   Messaging fee

    Messages sent per month: 60 \* 8 \* 30 \* 10,000 \* 2 = 288 million.

    Messages received per month: 60 \* 8 \* 30 \* 10,000 = 144 million.

    Total messages per month: 288 million + 144 million = 432 million.

    For each month, the first 100 million messages are charged at 0.5 dollars per 1 million messages. The following 332 million messages are charged at 0.4 dollars per 1 million messages. The messaging fee is: 100 \* 0.5 + 332 \* 0.4 = USD 182.8.

-   Device access fee

    Time that devices are online per month: 60 \* 8 \* 30 \* 10,000 = 144 million minutes.

    For each month, the device access fee is: 144 \* 0.3 = USD 43.2.

-   The total monthly fee is: 182.8 + 43.2 = USD 226.
