# CreateOTAVerifyJob

Creates a firmware verification job.

## Limits

-   You must verify a firmware before you push the firmware to devices for a batch update. Only verified firmware can be used to update devices in batches. You can call the [QueryOTAFirmware](~~147461~~) operation to view the status of the firmware verification.
-   You cannot initiate a verification job for a firmware that is being verified or has been verified.
-   You can specify a maximum of 10 devices for a firmware verification job.
-   Each Alibaba Cloud account can run a maximum of 10 queries per second \(QPS\).

**Note:** RAM users share the quota of the Alibaba Cloud account.
