# Configure alert contacts

If Cloud Monitor detects an exception, it sends an alert notification to an alert group by using an email or DingTalk chatbot message. You must create an alert contact and add the contact to the alert group. When you create an alert rule, select the alert group to receive alert notifications.

To receive alerts by using a DingTalk chatbot, you must create a DingTalk chatbot \(an intelligent assistant for a DingTalk group\) in the DingTalk application. For more information, see [Receive alert notifications in a DingTalk group](/intl.en-US/Best Practices/Receive alert notifications in a DingTalk group.md).

1.  Create an alert contact. For more information, see [Create an alert contact](/intl.en-US/Alarm service/Alert contacts/Create an alert contact or alert group.md).

2.  Create an alert group and add the alert contact to the alert group. For more information, see [Create an alert group](/intl.en-US/Alarm service/Alert contacts/Create an alert contact or alert group.md).

    You can also add alert contacts to an existing alert group. For more information, see [Add multiple alert contacts to an alert group at a time](/intl.en-US/Alarm service/Alert contacts/Create an alert contact or alert group.md).
